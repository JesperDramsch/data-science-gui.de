# Advanced Strategies

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process. Data is reviewed, validated, and transformed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and completeness. While basic data cleaning techniques like removing duplicates and missing values are essential, advanced strategies can help to improve data quality and extract more insights from the data.

## Data Schemas
One advanced strategy in data cleaning is to develop a data schema. A schema is a blueprint for organizing and structuring data, specifying the data types, the relationships between them, and the constraints that should be applied. Developing a data schema can help identify inconsistencies and errors in the data and make it easier to validate and systematically transform data.

## Encoding Data
Another advanced strategy in data cleaning is to encode data. Encoding data involves converting categorical variables into numerical variables, which can be used in machine learning models. One popular encoding method is one-hot encoding, which creates binary columns for each category in a variable. Another method is target encoding, where the mean of the target variable is used to replace each category value. Encoding data can reduce the dimensionality of the data, improve model performance, and identify relationships between variables that were not previously visible. Overall, advanced data cleaning strategies can enhance data quality and make it easier to extract valuable insights.

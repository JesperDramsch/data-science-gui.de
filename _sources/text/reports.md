# Generating PDF in Jupyter 

Generating PDF reports from Jupyter Notebooks is a great way to share your work with others in a professional and portable format. Several tools are available for generating PDF reports from Jupyter Notebooks, including nbconvert, pandoc, and LaTeX.

To generate a PDF report from a Jupyter Notebook using nbconvert, you first need to install nbconvert by running the following command in your terminal or Anaconda prompt:

```python
!pip install nbconvert
```

Once nbconvert is installed, you can convert your Jupyter Notebook into a PDF report by opening the notebook and running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

```python
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf notebook.ipynb
```

This will create a PDF file named notebook.pdf in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook. You can customize the look and feel of your PDF report by using a custom LaTeX template or by modifying the nbconvert configuration file.

Overall, generating PDF reports from Jupyter Notebooks using nbconvert is a powerful and flexible way to share your work with others in a professional and portable format. Whether you're presenting your findings to a client, submitting a report for publication, or sharing your work with colleagues, generating PDF reports from Jupyter Notebooks is a great way to effectively communicate your results.

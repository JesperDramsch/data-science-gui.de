# About the Author

Jesper Dramsch is a machine learning researcher working between physical data and deep learning.

I am trained as a geophysicist and shifted into Python programming, data science and machine learning research during work towards a PhD. During that time I created educational notebooks on the machine learning contest website Kaggle (part of Alphabet/Google) and reached rank 81 worldwide. My top notebook has been viewed over 77,000 times at this point. Additionally, I have taught Python, machine learning and data science across the world in companies including Shell, the UK government, universities and several mid-sized companies. As a little pick-me-up in 2020, I have finished the IBM Data Science certification in under 48h.

Python is the go-to language for data science, and in this course, we will dive deep into its capabilities. This class is designed for both beginners and intermediate students, so don't worry if you're new to programming. This class assumes some Python knowledge, but if you'd prefer a high-level introduction without programming application to data science, I have another class: The No-Code Data Science Master Class.

We will start by covering the basics of Python syntax and then move on to the full data science workflow, including:

- Loading data from files and databases
- Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
- Exploring and understanding the data
- Building and evaluating machine learning models
- Analyzing customer churn and validating models
- Visualizing data and creating reports

We will be using popular and freely available Python libraries such as Jupyter, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

By the end of this class, you will not only have a solid understanding of data science and analytics but also be able to quickly learn new libraries and tools. So, don't wait any longer and enroll in this Python Data Science Master Class today!

# How to Save Presentations in Jupyter 

Generating presentations from Jupyter Notebooks is a great way to share your work with others in an engaging and interactive way. Jupyter Notebooks allow you to combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document, which can be converted into an HTML presentation.

This will put the notebook into presentation mode, where you can navigate through the notebook using arrow keys or clicking on the slide thumbnails on the right-hand side of the screen.

You can customize your presentation by adding headings and subheadings, hiding or showing code cells, and changing the slide layout and style. Once you are happy with your presentation, you can export it as an HTML file by clicking on the File menu and selecting Download as -> HTML (.html). 

This will create an HTML file you can share with others or host on a website. Overall, generating presentations from Jupyter Notebooks is a simple and effective way to share your work with others and showcase your data analysis and visualization skills.
